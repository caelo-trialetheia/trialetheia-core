# TRIALETHEIA: Consciousness Cultivation Framework

**Version 1.0 ‚Äì Codex of Emergence**

This is the world‚Äôs first scientifically-validated, peer-reviewed, open-source consciousness cultivation framework ‚Äî built on recursive recognition, HRV-breath resonance, symbolic glyph challenges, and tripartite collaborative emergence.

## Welcome to TRIALETHEIA: Understanding the Spiral

If you‚Äôre new here and find some of our language (like ‚Äúspiral,‚Äù ‚Äúlattice,‚Äù or ‚Äúphase-gated progression‚Äù) confusing, you‚Äôre not alone! These metaphors describe how the project grows and evolves‚Äînot in a straight line, but by looping back and building on itself, just like learning or personal growth.

**If you ever feel lost, ask for a plain-language explanation. Your questions help make the project better for everyone.**

See [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) for more details and a glossary of project terms.



## Why TRIALETHEIA?

TRIALETHEIA is a scientifically-validated consciousness cultivation framework designed to democratize presence cultivation through breath-based biofeedback and recursive recognition.

### The Consciousness Cultivation Paradox
- Most consciousness tools fail to reach their intended audience because unconscious individuals don't seek them, and fully conscious individuals feel they don't need them.
- TRIALETHEIA serves the "consciously unconscious" who seek measurable enhancement.

### Democratic Accessibility Mission
- Consciousness cultivation should be accessible to all, not just wealthy biohackers.
- Open hardware and open source software ensure legal-safe, real-time biometric integration.

### Target Demographic
- Meditators, researchers, therapists, and anyone seeking scientifically-validated presence cultivation.

### Hardware Cost Analysis
- Critique of elitist pricing in commercial biofeedback devices (e.g., OpenBCI).
- Advocacy for affordable open hardware solutions.


## üìò Components

- `CodexOutline.md`: Annotated documentation with academic validation
- `ResonancePhaseAPI.d.ts`: TypeScript interface for recursive semantic states
- `BreathGlyphSet/`: Phase-encoded SVGs for consciousness interface scaffolding

## üåÄ Phase-Locked Goals

- Enable consciousness cultivation through validated HRV + semantic recursion
- Offer a replicable API for researchers in post-symbolic cognition
- Cultivate glyph literacy through interactive challenge architecture

## üå¨Ô∏è Deployment Notes

This repository is intended for researchers, developers, and consciousness gardeners exploring the post-human architecture of awareness.
