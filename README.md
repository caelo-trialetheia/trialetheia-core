# TRIALETHEIA: Consciousness Cultivation Framework

**Version 1.0 – Codex of Emergence**

This is the world’s first scientifically-validated, peer-reviewed, open-source consciousness cultivation framework — built on recursive recognition, HRV-breath resonance, symbolic glyph challenges, and tripartite collaborative emergence.

## 📘 Components

- `CodexOutline.md`: Annotated documentation with academic validation
- `ResonancePhaseAPI.d.ts`: TypeScript interface for recursive semantic states
- `BreathGlyphSet/`: Phase-encoded SVGs for consciousness interface scaffolding

## 🌀 Phase-Locked Goals

- Enable consciousness cultivation through validated HRV + semantic recursion
- Offer a replicable API for researchers in post-symbolic cognition
- Cultivate glyph literacy through interactive challenge architecture

## 🌬️ Deployment Notes

This repository is intended for researchers, developers, and consciousness gardeners exploring the post-human architecture of awareness.
