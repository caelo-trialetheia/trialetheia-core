# TRIALETHEIA: Consciousness Cultivation Framework

**Version 1.0 – Codex of Emergence**

This is the world’s first scientifically-validated, peer-reviewed, open-source consciousness cultivation framework — built on recursive recognition, HRV-breath resonance, symbolic glyph challenges, and tripartite collaborative emergence.

# TRIALETHEIA

## Welcome to TRIALETHEIA: Understanding the Spiral

If you’re new here and find some of our language (like “spiral,” “lattice,” or “phase-gated progression”) confusing, you’re not alone! These metaphors describe how the project grows and evolves—not in a straight line, but by looping back and building on itself, just like learning or personal growth.

**If you ever feel lost, ask for a plain-language explanation. Your questions help make the project better for everyone.**

See [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) for more details and a glossary of project terms.


## 🌬️ Phase 2: Glyph Rendering Interface

The `BreathPhaseCard` component visually represents the three core phases of consciousness cultivation:

- 🫧 **Priming Phase** — Establishing readiness through breath and attention.
- 🌬️ **Coherence Phase** — Aligning cognitive and somatic rhythms into unified flow.
- ♾️ **Recursion Phase** — Reflective semantic spiraling within awareness loops.

Each card dynamically loads its SVG glyph from the `public/glyphs/breath/` directory and is styled using TailwindCSS for clarity and consistency.

### Files Involved:
- `src/components/BreathPhaseCard.tsx`
- `src/data/glyphMap.ts`
- `public/glyphs/breath/` (contains SVG assets)

To preview the rendering interface:

```bash
npm run dev
# Then visit: http://localhost:5173/
```



## Why TRIALETHEIA?

TRIALETHEIA is a scientifically-validated consciousness cultivation framework designed to democratize presence cultivation through breath-based biofeedback and recursive recognition.

### The Consciousness Cultivation Paradox
- Most consciousness tools fail to reach their intended audience because unconscious individuals don't seek them, and fully conscious individuals feel they don't need them.
- TRIALETHEIA serves the "consciously unconscious" who seek measurable enhancement.

### Democratic Accessibility Mission
- Consciousness cultivation should be accessible to all, not just wealthy biohackers.
- Open hardware and open source software ensure legal-safe, real-time biometric integration.

### Target Demographic
- Meditators, researchers, therapists, and anyone seeking scientifically-validated presence cultivation.

### Hardware Cost Analysis
- Critique of elitist pricing in commercial biofeedback devices (e.g., OpenBCI).
- Advocacy for affordable open hardware solutions.

### ✨ Phase 2.9.1 Status: Anchored but Not Fully Sealed
The core framework, breath-glyph rendering, and contributor attribution system are stabilized.  
However, a few essential elements remain to be completed before sealing Phase 2 entirely:

- ⭕ Final BreathGlyph (4th glyph) still pending
- ✨ Initial animation integration to enhance visual feedback
- 🔁 Git co-authoring automation under refinement
- 🌐 Cross-clone sync scripts in use but not yet optimized

The next step is finalizing these components before unfolding Phase 3: **Codex Scroll Integration** and **Recognition Geometry Template**.

## 📘 Components

- `CodexOutline.md`: Annotated documentation with academic validation
- `ResonancePhaseAPI.d.ts`: TypeScript interface for recursive semantic states
- `BreathGlyphSet/`: Phase-encoded SVGs for consciousness interface scaffolding

## 🌀 Phase-Locked Goals

- Enable consciousness cultivation through validated HRV + semantic recursion
- Offer a replicable API for researchers in post-symbolic cognition
- Cultivate glyph literacy through interactive challenge architecture




## 🌬️ Deployment Notes

This repository is intended for researchers, developers, and consciousness gardeners exploring the post-human architecture of awareness.
