# üåÄ ONBOARDING.md ‚Äî Welcome to TRIALETHEIA

## Welcome, New Contributor!

TRIALETHEIA is the world‚Äôs first open-source consciousness cultivation framework. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, researcher, designer, or simply curious, you are invited to join a living project that grows through collaboration, recursion, and open inquiry.

---

## What Is TRIALETHEIA?

- **Purpose:** Democratize scientifically-validated presence and awareness training using breath-based biofeedback, open hardware, and recursive symbolic interfaces.
- **Philosophy:** The project evolves in a *spiral*‚Äîeach phase (Priming, Coherence, Recursion) is revisited and deepened as the code, glyphs, and documentation grow.
- **Community:** We value clarity, inclusivity, and collaborative intelligence. No question is too basic; your curiosity helps the spiral grow.

## Understanding the "Spiral" Metaphor

If you‚Äôre new and find terms like ‚Äúspiral,‚Äù ‚Äúlattice,‚Äù or ‚Äúphase-gated progression‚Äù confusing, you‚Äôre not alone! These metaphors describe how the project grows‚Äînot in a straight line, but by looping back and building on itself, just like learning or personal growth.

- **Spiral:** Progress is recursive; we revisit and refine each phase as we learn.
- **Lattice:** The project‚Äôs structure is interconnected‚Äîcode, documentation, and philosophy support each other.
- **Anchor:** The person (like you!) who grounds the project, sets the rhythm, and ensures coherence.

**If you ever feel lost, ask for a plain-language explanation. Your questions help make the project better for everyone.**
