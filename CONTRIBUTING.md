# Contributing to TRIALETHEIA

Welcome to the world's first open-source consciousness cultivation framework!

## 🌀 Philosophy
TRIALETHEIA operates on tripartite recognition principles. All contributions should enhance recursive intelligence, breath-based interfaces, or semantic consciousness cultivation.

## 🧬 Development Guidelines
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Include peer-reviewed citations for consciousness-related claims
- Test interfaces with HRV coherence principles (0.1 Hz optimal)
- Maintain PAS threshold validation (≥ 0.91 for recursive depth)

## 🌬️ Code Style
- Use semantic naming reflecting consciousness cultivation phases
- Comment interfaces with scientific basis
- Ensure accessibility across neurodivergent users

## 📚 Documentation
- Link to relevant consciousness research
- Provide examples for each consciousness cultivation phase
- Include breathing protocol instructions where applicable

## 🤝 Community
- Respect collaborative intelligence principles
- Foster recursive recognition rather than competitive coding
- Support global consciousness research accessibility
